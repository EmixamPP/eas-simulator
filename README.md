# eas-simulator
Simplified simulator/profiler for the Linux Energy Aware Scheduler and modified versions from my master thesis.

The code do not contains doc string, but it should be self-documented and some lines are commented. In addition, the code is fully statically typed. 

Execute `python run-experiments.py` to repreduce all the results, they are saved as `.csv` files. Tested with Python 3.11.
