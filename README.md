# eas-simulator
Code repository used to produce the results of my master thesis.\
It contains a simplified moduler simulator with a profiler for the Linux Energy Aware Scheduler, along with multiple modified versions from my work.\
And two scripts that runs the experiments and generates the results that I conduct in my report. Require `python >= 3.10`.

Execute `python run-scheduling-exp.py` to repreduce the results about the scheduling experiments, they are saved as `.csv` files.

Execute `python run-binpacking-exp.py` to reproduce the results about the bin packing experiments, they are also saved as `.csv` files.
