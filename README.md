# eas-simulator
Simplified simulator/profiler for the Linux Energy Aware Scheduler and modified versions from my master thesis.

The code do not contains doc string, but it should be self-documented and some lines are commented. In addition, the code is fully statically typed. 

Execute `python run-experiments.py` to repreduce the results about the scheduler experiments, they are saved as `.csv` files.

And execute `bin_packing.py` to reproduce the results about the bin packing of worst-fit and nextfit under condition, they are also saved as `.csv` files.  

Compatible with Python >= 3.10.
